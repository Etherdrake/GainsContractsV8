 Diamonds are modular smart contract systems that can be upgraded/extended after deployment, and have virtually no size limit. More technically, a diamond is a contract with external functions that are supplied by contracts called facets. Facets are separate, independent contracts that can share internal functions, libraries, and state variables.

1. A diamond is a facade smart contract that delegatecalls into its facets to execute function calls. A diamond is stateful. Data is stored in the contract storage of a diamond.
2. A facet is a stateless smart contract or Solidity library with external functions. A facet is deployed and one or more of its functions are added to one or more diamonds. A facet does not store data within its own contract storage but it can define state and read and write to the storage of one or more diamonds. The term facet comes from the diamond industry. It is a side, or flat surface of a diamond.
3. A loupe facet is a facet that provides introspection functions. In the diamond industry, a loupe is a magnifying glass that is used to look at diamonds.
4. An immutable function is an external function that cannot be replaced or removed (because it is defined directly in the diamond, or because the diamondâ€™s logic does not allow it to be modified).
5. A mapping for the purposes of this EIP is an association between two things and does not refer to a specific implementation.
